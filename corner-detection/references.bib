abstract = {A corner is defined as the junction point of two or more straight line edges. Corners are special features in a image. They are of great use in computing the optical flow and structure from motion. In this paper, we report an optimal corner detector which uses a mathematical model for a corner. An optimal gray tone corner detector is derived for a restricted case of corners, i.e., corners made by lines which are symmetric about a horizontal axis. The resultant corner detector is described by the product of the sine in x and an exponential in the y direction in a portion of the mask and by the product of two sines in x and y directions in the remaining portion. It is then generalized to include any corner of an arbitrary angle and orientation. This results in an approximation of all corners by a total of twelve major types. It is observed that all the twelve masks can actually be configured with four smaller sub-masks, and this results in a significant reduction in the computations. The computations are further reduced by using the separability of masks. Results for synthetic and real scenes are reported.},

 abstract={This paper sets out to study the effect of digitization on curvature. It is put forward that digital curvature is an estimate with accuracy and precision. A theoretical analysis of the curvature estimation problem identifies the possible sources of errors in digital curvature estimation. In the literature, five essentially different classes of methods are found. From theoretical analysis of the methods, as well as by random experiments on generated arcs, we establish that almost all existing methods suffer from a severe directional inaccuracy and/or poor precision. Errors depend on the method, orientation, and scale, ranging from 1% to over 1000%. We present a practical solution with a residual error between 1% and 60%, also giving recommendations for the required resolution of the image.},

 abstract={In this paper we introduce a new curvature estimator based on global optimisation. This method called Global Min-Curvature exploits the geometric properties of digital contours by using local bounds on tangent directions defined by the maximal digital straight segments. The estimator is adapted to noisy contours by replacing maximal segments with maximal blurred digital straight segments. Experimentations on perfect and damaged digital contours are performed and in both cases, comparisons with other existing methods are presented.},
